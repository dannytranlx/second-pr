### Asset compilation

Install Gulp and compile the assets:

```
  $ npm install # to install dependencies
  $ npm install -g gulp
  $ gulp js     # will concat/compress js/*  into firstpr.js
  $ gulp sass    # will concat/compress css/* into firstpr.css
```

During development just run `gulp` in a separate console for continuous compilation. (Gulp will watch for changes in the js/ and css/ directories and run the respective tasks.)
